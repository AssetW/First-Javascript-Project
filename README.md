# First-Javascript-Project
My first Javascript project from a Udemy tutorial by Jonas Schmedtmann

I've started trying to learn programming again begin this week and I'm still going strong. 
I think it became alot easyer to learn Javascript because I went from free tutorials on the
internet to a payed tutorial on Udemy. I'm learning alot and hope to make some sick projects
in the future! If you read this file and see my code, please give feedback about spacing and
optimalisation and stuff because I could really use feedback :).
